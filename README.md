# Video Retrieval Using TransNetV2 and CLIP

## Overview

This project is a video retrieval application that combines TransNetV2 and CLIP to identify videos containing scenes matching a textual description. The system extracts keyframes from videos, processes their features using CLIP, and allows for efficient search and retrieval based on semantic similarity between textual descriptions and visual data.

## Workflow

### 1. Keyframe Extraction:

* Use TransNetV2, a pre-trained model for scene detection, to identify and extract keyframes from input videos. TransNetV2 helps isolate important frames that represent distinct scenes, reducing computational overhead and focusing on meaningful content.

### 2. Feature Extraction with CLIP:

* Process the extracted keyframes using CLIP (Contrastive Languageâ€“Image Pretraining), a powerful model trained to align text and image representations.

* CLIP encodes the keyframes and user-provided textual descriptions into a shared embedding space, enabling comparison between textual and visual data.

### 3. Scene Description and Matching:

* Input a description of the desired scene.

* CLIP compares the input text's embedding with the embeddings of the extracted keyframes.

### 4. Video Retrieval:

* Retrieve the video(s) containing the scene most similar to the input description based on the similarity scores.
